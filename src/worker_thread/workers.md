#### WORKERS

Workers (threads) are useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations. They do not help much with I/O-intensive work. The Node.js built-in asynchronous I/O operations are more efficient than Workers can be.

Unlike child_process or cluster, worker_threads can share memory. They do so by transferring ArrayBuffer instances or sharing SharedArrayBuffer instances.


#### When to use Workers, child_process.fork(), and Cluster in Node.js depends on various factors such as the nature of your application, the workload, and the resources available. Here's a brief overview of each and when to use them:

Workers (worker_threads module):

Workers are lightweight threads within a Node.js process. They provide a way to run JavaScript computations in parallel.
Use Workers when you want to perform CPU-intensive tasks asynchronously without blocking the main event loop.
They are suitable for tasks like heavy computations, image processing, or CPU-bound tasks.
Workers are recommended when you need to scale computation across multiple CPU cores.
Workers are part of the Node.js core, available since Node.js version 10.5.0.
child_process.fork():

child_process.fork() creates a new Node.js process similar to spawn, but it also establishes a communication channel between the parent and child process.
Use child_process.fork() when you need to create separate instances of your application to take advantage of multiple CPU cores.
It's suitable for running multiple instances of the same application, such as in a cluster setup.
Each forked process has its own event loop and memory space, making them suitable for isolated tasks or independent services.
Communication between the parent and child processes can be achieved through inter-process communication (IPC) using message passing.
child_process.fork() is a built-in module in Node.js, available since the early versions.
Cluster:

Cluster module allows you to create multiple instances of a Node.js application, each running on a separate core.
It's a wrapper around child_process.fork() and provides built-in support for distributing incoming connections among the child processes.
Use Cluster when you need to scale your Node.js application horizontally to handle more incoming requests.
It's suitable for creating a multi-process setup for web servers, where each instance can handle incoming HTTP requests.
Cluster simplifies load balancing and ensures high availability by automatically restarting workers that terminate unexpectedly.
Cluster is part of the Node.js core and has been available since Node.js version 0.8.0.
In summary:

Use Workers for CPU-intensive tasks within a single Node.js process.
Use child_process.fork() for creating separate instances of your application for parallel processing or isolated tasks.
Use Cluster for scaling your Node.js application horizontally across multiple CPU cores to handle more incoming requests efficiently.
